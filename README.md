# HawkesClassification

This code in Python has been realised by Christophe Denis, Charlotte Dion and Laure Sansonnet. 
It permits to replicate one of the examples given in the article Multiclass Classification for Hawkes Processes (2021), available on HAL.

The purpose is to solve a multiclass classification task from data coming from simple linear Hawkes processes.

This projet is ongoing and will be extended in the multivariate case.
